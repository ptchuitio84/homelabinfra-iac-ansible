# homelabinfra-iac-ansible

Managing infrastructure by hand doesn't scale — and it doesn't teach you anything repeatable. This repository is the configuration management and automation layer for a production-grade private cloud built on VMware, Ansible, and Jenkins. Every host is provisioned from code, configured from code, monitored from code, and patched from code. Nothing in this environment exists outside of version control.

Built to close the gap between hyperscale operational experience and hands-on infrastructure engineering — and to prove that the two aren't mutually exclusive. Designed and built in roughly 10 days of focused evening work using AI-assisted development (Claude Code), applying 15 years of infrastructure pattern recognition to a greenfield environment from scratch.

## Design Principles

These aren't aspirational. Every decision in this repo traces back to one of these.

**Everything in version control.**
No configuration exists only in a UI, only in a running VM's state, or only in someone's memory. If it's not in git, it doesn't exist.

**Idempotent by default.**
Every playbook is safe to re-run against a live host at any time. `state: present` over shell scripts. `creates:` guards on one-shot operations. Roles self-detect whether work is needed before doing it.

**Secrets never in plaintext.**
`ansible-vault` encrypts all credentials before they touch disk or git. The vault password file is the only secret outside version control, and it lives only on the control node.

**Data separated from OS.**
Every service that writes persistent data gets a dedicated disk. This makes VM snapshots clean (OS disk only), disk expansion non-disruptive, and VM rebuilds fast — clone template, reattach data disk, run role.

**No snowflake hosts.**
Every VM is fully reproducible: golden template + Ansible role. If a host is lost, recovery is: clone template, run role, done. No manual steps, no institutional memory required.

**Monitoring is not optional.**
`node_exporter` is deployed to every Linux VM at provisioning time, not retroactively. You cannot operate infrastructure you cannot observe.

**Blast radius is bounded.**
Network automation lives in a separate repository. Windows automation uses scoped service accounts. Ansible vault passwords are per-environment. A mistake in one domain cannot cascade into another.

**Pipelines over ad-hoc.**
Production changes run through Jenkins pipelines with audit trails. Direct `ansible-playbook` invocations are for development and break-glass scenarios only.

## Infrastructure Overview

The lab runs 12 Linux VMs, 4 Windows VMs, 3 ESXi hosts, and 4 network devices across two DNS domains (`nnt.com` for Linux/infrastructure, `nanonetech.com` for Windows/AD). Full inventory detail is in [`inventory/`](./inventory/).

**Linux services:** Ansible control node, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, NFS, Harbor, Vault, k3s (×3), Nginx, NetBox

**Windows services:** Active Directory / DNS, ADCS Root CA (offline-capable), ADCS Sub-CA (issuing), Exchange Server, vCenter 7

**Network:** Meraki MX64 (edge/WAN), Arista 7050SX (L3 spine, VRRP master), Arista 7048T (VRRP secondary), Cisco Catalyst 3750G (VRRP backup)

**Physical hosts:** 3× Dell ESXi hosts with iDRAC fan control managed via IPMI

---

## PKI Architecture

The lab runs a two-tier certificate hierarchy modeled after enterprise PKI design. Every TLS certificate in the environment — from ESXi host identity to container registry to secrets management — chains to a CA under our control.

```
NNT-NANONETECH-CA  (Root CA)
│  Self-signed | Valid: 2026–2046
│  hmvwapca001 | Taken offline after Sub-CA issuance
│
└── NNT-NANONETECH-Sub-CA  (Subordinate / Issuing CA)
    │  Valid: 2026–2031 | hmvwapca002 | Always online
    │  Issues all end-entity certs via ADCS + WebServer template
    │
    ├── VMCA  (VMware CA — made subordinate to Sub-CA)
    │   │  Valid: 2026–2031 | Installed on vCenter
    │   └── vCenter Machine SSL cert
    │
    ├── ESXi host certs  (hsplv021, hsplv022, hsplv034)
    │
    ├── Harbor TLS cert
    ├── Vault TLS cert
    └── Linux CA trust store
        Distributed via distribute_root_ca.yml to all managed Linux hosts
```

**Why a two-tier hierarchy with an offline root?**
The root CA's only operational function is to sign the subordinate CA certificate. Everything else flows through the sub-CA. If the sub-CA is compromised or needs replacement, a new sub-CA can be issued from the root without invalidating the root trust anchor already distributed to every client. The offline root is a risk containment decision — you cannot compromise a CA that isn't reachable.

**Why make VMCA a subordinate CA instead of issuing all vSphere certs directly from Sub-CA?**
VMCA manages an internal ecosystem of solution user certificates, service TLS, and host identity certs that would require significant manual overhead to issue individually from an external CA. Making VMCA subordinate to our PKI brings the entire vSphere certificate chain under our control — every internal vCenter cert chains to NNT-NANONETECH-CA — without taking on the operational burden of manually managing dozens of internal certs.

---

## Identity & Authentication

All Linux VMs are domain-joined to `nanonetech.com` via `realmd` + `SSSD`. Authentication is centralized through Active Directory. Local user accounts are minimized to root and service accounts only.

```
AD (nanonetech.com)
├── DNS — authoritative for nnt.com and nanonetech.com
├── Group Policy — Windows host configuration enforcement
├── SSSD (Linux) — PAM/NSS integration for all managed Linux VMs
│   └── "NNT Linux Admins" AD group → sudo rights on all Linux hosts
└── ADCS — PKI issuance for the entire lab
```

**Why AD-integrated Linux auth?**
Access control changes happen in one place. Add or remove someone from the "NNT Linux Admins" group in AD, and the change propagates to all Linux VMs at next login — no Ansible run required, no per-host user management, no SSH key rotation across a fleet. This is how enterprise Linux fleets are managed at scale, and this lab reflects that pattern.

---

## CI/CD — Jenkins Pipelines

Ansible playbooks are not run by hand in production. Everything that touches live infrastructure runs through a Jenkins pipeline with a full audit trail — who triggered it, what changed, what the output was.

| Pipeline | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `nnt-jkn-lin-patch` | Weekly (scheduled) | `dnf update` all Linux VMs, reboot if required, validate all services post-reboot |
| `nnt-jkn-provision-vm` | On demand | Clone VM from golden template via vCenter API, set hostname/IP/DNS, wait for SSH readiness |
| `nnt-jkn-setup-k3s` | On demand | Bootstrap k3s control plane and join workers to cluster |
| `nnt-jkn-net-backup` | Daily (scheduled) | Pull running configs from all network devices, commit to git with timestamp |
| `nnt-jkn-net-enforce-swplnet251/252/253` | On demand | Push and verify baseline config against a specific switch |
| `nnt-jkn-win-dns-sync` | On demand | Sync DNS A records from NetBox IPAM to Active Directory DNS |

**Why Jenkins for infrastructure automation instead of a SaaS CI platform?**
All pipelines target on-premises infrastructure — vCenter, WinRM endpoints, SSH, network device SSH — none of which are reachable from a cloud-hosted runner without a VPN or tunnel. A self-hosted Jenkins instance on the same L2 segment eliminates that dependency entirely. Jenkins also gives full control over pipeline agent configuration, credentials management, and job scheduling with no per-minute billing.

---

## Observability Stack

All metrics, logs, and dashboards are self-hosted. No telemetry leaves the lab. The stack is designed so that a failure in any single component does not take down the others.

**Metrics pipeline:**
```
node_exporter     (port 9100)  ── all Linux VMs ──────────────────────┐
vmware_exporter   (port 9272)  ── vCenter API → ESXi host metrics ────┤
snmp_exporter     (port 9116)  ── Cisco 3750G + Arista switches ───────┤──► Prometheus (9090)
meraki_exporter   (custom)     ── Meraki MX64 REST API ────────────────┤
unpoller          (port 9130)  ── UniFi AP metrics ────────────────────┤
Jenkins metrics   (port 8080)  ── build queue, executor utilization ───┘
```

**Log pipeline:**
```
Promtail (all Linux VMs)  ──────────────────────────────► Loki (3100)
  Sources: systemd journal
           /var/log/* per host
```

**Visualization:** Grafana with Prometheus + Loki datasources. Dashboards cover Linux hosts, VMware/ESXi, Cisco/Arista SNMP, Meraki WAN, UniFi wireless, and Jenkins build health.

**Why three separate monitoring VMs?**
Prometheus is write-heavy (constant scrape cycles, TSDB compaction). Grafana is read-heavy (query bursts when dashboards load). Loki is ingest-heavy (continuous log writes from all hosts). Co-locating these workloads masks resource contention, makes capacity planning ambiguous, and means restarting one component affects the others. Dedicated VMs give clean resource attribution and independent restart capability.

---

## Platform Services

**HashiCorp Vault** — Secrets management for the lab. Initialized and unsealed. Unseal keys stored offline, not in this repository. Intended use: dynamic secrets issuance, PKI intermediate CA, TLS cert storage for platform services, and app-layer secrets for Kubernetes workloads.

**Harbor Container Registry** — Self-hosted OCI-compliant registry. TLS cert issued by NNT-NANONETECH-Sub-CA and trusted by all lab hosts. All container images used by Kubernetes workloads are pulled from Harbor. There is no runtime dependency on Docker Hub, quay.io, or any external registry — a WAN outage does not affect running or rescheduled workloads.

**NetBox** — IPAM and DCIM source of truth. Every IP allocation is tracked in NetBox. The `nnt-jkn-win-dns-sync` pipeline reads NetBox and pushes DNS A records to Active Directory DNS, eliminating manual DNS management and keeping IPAM and DNS in sync automatically.

**NFS Server** — Dedicated NFS server providing 250GB XFS persistent volume storage for the k3s cluster, consumed via `nfs-subdir-external-provisioner`. The cluster's default StorageClass — any workload requesting a PVC gets a dynamically provisioned subdirectory with no manual intervention.

---

## Kubernetes (k3s)

Lightweight production-grade Kubernetes on OL9.7. Three-node cluster: one control plane, two workers.

**Storage design:** The `local-path` StorageClass default is explicitly disabled and patched out. All persistent storage flows through the NFS StorageClass. This is a deliberate decision — `local-path` storage is node-local, meaning a pod rescheduled to a different worker loses its data. NFS-backed storage survives node failure and pod rescheduling transparently.

**Container images:** All workload images are pulled from Harbor. The k3s cluster is configured with Harbor as the registry mirror — external registries are not in the critical path.

**Why k3s and not kubeadm?**
k3s ships as a single binary with an embedded SQLite datastore suitable for clusters below ~10 nodes. A kubeadm-managed cluster at this scale requires an external etcd cluster (3 nodes minimum for HA), a separate load balancer for the API server, and significantly more operational overhead to maintain. k3s is production software — it runs in edge deployments at scale. It is not a simplified version of Kubernetes; it is a fully conformant distribution with a lower operational surface area.

---

## VM Provisioning

VMs are provisioned zero-touch using the `provision_vm` role, which wraps `community.vmware.vmware_guest`. Every VM is cloned from a sealed golden template — VMware Guest Customization handles hostname, static IP assignment, and AD DNS registration at clone time.

**Golden Template: `PLTMPOL904242026`**

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | Oracle Linux 9.7, fully patched at build date |
| Packages | open-vm-tools, cloud-init, perl, python3, dnf-utils, chrony |
| cloud-init | VMware datasource only; `network: config: disabled` |
| SSH | Key-based only, root, id_ed25519 pre-loaded |
| Sealed | machine-id cleared, SSH host keys removed, cloud-init state cleaned |

**Why `cloud-init` with `network: config: disabled`?**
cloud-init with the VMware datasource handles post-clone injection (hostname, SSH keys). Disabling its network management prevents it from overwriting the static IP applied by VMware Guest Customization on first boot — a race condition that would leave the VM unreachable without console access. Guest Customization owns IP configuration; cloud-init owns everything else.

**Disk layout — all VMs:**

| Disk | Mount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| OS disk (30–60GB) | `/`, `/boot` | Operating system, LVM root, swap |
| Data disk (60–250GB) | `/data` | Service-specific data — TSDB, logs, build artifacts, registry blobs |

VMware SCSI slot assignment is non-deterministic across clones. All roles detect the data disk at runtime by finding the largest unpartitioned disk — no device names are hardcoded, and fstab uses UUID exclusively.

---

## Network Automation

Network device configurations are version-controlled in the companion [`homelabinfra-iac-network`](https://github.com/ptchuitio84/homelabinfra-network-configs) repository. This separation is intentional — network configs use a different tooling chain, different change velocity, and different review criteria than Linux/Windows automation. Mixing them creates blast radius risk: a syntax error in a Linux playbook should not be in the same pipeline that can push a broken config to a switch.

What this repo handles for networking:
- `network_backup.yml` — triggers the Jenkins backup pipeline, commits running configs to the network repo
- `vlan_audit_swplnet*.yml` — validates VLAN consistency across all three switches
- `vrrp_validate.yml` — verifies VRRP master/backup state matches expected priority
- `enforce_baseline_swplnet*.yml` — pushes and verifies baseline config against a specific switch

| Platform | Collection | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| Cisco Catalyst 3750G (IOS 12.x) | cisco.ios | SSH (legacy KEX — must run from ans001, not Mac) |
| Arista 7050SX / 7048T (EOS 4.x) | arista.eos | SSH |
| Meraki MX64 | REST API | HTTPS (Meraki SDK) |

---

## Backup

All VMs are protected by Veeam Backup & Replication following a 3-2-1 strategy: 3 copies of data, 2 different storage media types, 1 logically isolated copy. Veeam configuration is managed separately from this Ansible repo. Its existence is called out here because any infrastructure runbook that omits backup context is incomplete — these two concerns are tightly coupled operationally.

---

## Secrets Management

All credentials are encrypted with `ansible-vault` before commit. The vault password lives only on the Ansible control node and is never committed.

```
inventory/group_vars/*/vault.yml     # Encrypted — safe to commit
inventory/host_vars/*/vault.yml      # Encrypted — safe to commit
~/.ansible/vault_pass.txt            # NEVER committed — control node only
```

Running any playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/<category>/<playbook>.yml \
  -i inventory/ \
  --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/vault_pass.txt
```

Targeting a single host:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/linux/patch_linux_vms.yml \
  -i inventory/ \
  --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/vault_pass.txt \
  --limit hmvlapmon001.nnt.com
```

## Requirements

```bash
# Control node: hmvlapans001 (OL9.7)
ansible-core==2.15.13    # Pinned — see note below

# Install all required collections
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

> **On the ansible-core version pin:** OL9 ships Python 3.9 as the system interpreter. `ansible-core` 2.16 dropped support for Python 3.9 on the controller. Upgrading requires either installing Python 3.10+ alongside the system Python or migrating the control node. This is tracked — it is a deliberate constraint, not an oversight. Bump `ansible-core` only after validating the Python upgrade path on ans001.

## A note on development approach

This environment was designed and built using AI-assisted development (Claude Code) as an accelerant — not as a replacement for engineering judgment. Every architectural decision, design rationale, and tradeoff documented here reflects deliberate choices made by someone who has operated infrastructure at hyperscale. The AI handled syntax and boilerplate. The thinking is human.

This is how infrastructure engineering works in 2025. Architects who can direct AI tooling to execute their vision build faster and better than those who don't. This repo is evidence of that.
